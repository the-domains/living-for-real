# Dominican Vacation - Travel to
![A much needed vacation. We went to the Dominican Republic without the kids. ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/95b8231b-70b1-4d2e-8254-a5cfcb805db4.jpg)

For a year we have been planning this trip. My uncle is getting married on May 24th to a wonderful lady who makes him very happy. They decided on a destination wedding in the Dominican Republic. Late Friday, May 20th, we flew out of town after dropping my kids off at my aunt's house.

My aunt has 5 kids of her own, so with my 4 there will be 9 kids in a 3 bedroom house. Luckily her oldest two are 15 years old so they can be a big help. I am so grateful for her and her family that they can help me like this.

We flew for hours, leaving at 11:45 pm home time and arriving at our destination at 3 pm (ish) home time. We had a 1.5 hour layover at JFK in the middle, but it wasn't enough for a good stretch. When we landed my butt really hurt. Then we took a 3 hour bus ride before finally reaching the gorgeous villa.
