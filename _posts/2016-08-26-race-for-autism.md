  The Utah Autism Coalition is sponsoring our first semi-annual 5k and Fun Run.
  All proceeds raised for this race will go to the coalition. They are a great
  organization that helps families who have children with autism navigate the
  insurance conundrum. If you are interested in racing, or if you just want to
  donate to the cause, go to the race entry page here.
