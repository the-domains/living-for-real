  It is so easy for me to just take care of things, especially while raising 4
  autistic kids. I'm sure most of you mothers would agree with me that that is
  what tends to happen. We tend to put everyone else's needs, especially our
  kiddos special or otherwise, first. With cleaning the house, meals, laundry,
  bedtime, bathtime, school, appointments, and everything in between we just
  don't have time for ourselves. That doesn't include vacations, family
  gatherings, or holidays. We deem these things so important that we just push
  forward. I learned the hard way the importance of taking the time to breathe
  and let someone take care of me. And for that my husband called me a
  hypocrite.

July 26th 2016 I went to Nashville, TN for the annual Beachbody convention (Summit). This was our second year in Nashville and my 3rd time going to Summit. This year I decided to certify in Insanity Live, meaning that I can teach a live insanity class. Insanity being my most favorite workout program. I had gone to convention and even Nashville before with no problem, but this year would be different. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/11556d2c-e7b8-4546-9596-6ce1130c88aa.png)

I needed this weekend because I was drained from taking care of my kiddos and it would be great to just take some time without them and worry about only me. I started Wednesday morning with an Insanity live workout for certification and 3/4 of the way through I had to leave the room to cool off because I was getting too hot and slightly light headed. I cooled off, was feeling better, and went back into the group to finish certification. I had nothing going on the rest of the evening or even Thursday morning. Everything was going great so I went to my Thursday evening workout and did 22 Minute Hard Corps with Tony Horton. Thursday night is where it started going wrong. After the workout we had opening ceremonies to start the convention and then 2 days of classes. After opening ceremonies I had to be helped back to the car and went straight to bed without even changing out of my workout clothes because I was so tired, but I still didn't want it to stop me. So I pushed on.

Friday morning I was feeling better, at least I told myself, so I went with my team to the morning session. In addition to feeling the need to take care of everything myself I'm also stubborn and feel like I should be able to take care of me and not have someone else do it. I was and still am grateful that I had a friend there who could be just as stubborn. We went to lunch and then checked out the CORE (the store set up for Summit). After leaving she knew something was wrong because I either needed to keep moving or I had to sit down. She convinced me to go to the First aid station they had set up and have them check me out. It was a good thing I did. My blood pressure could not regulate itself they way it is supposed to between sitting down and standing up so I was told that I should go to the ER and have them check me out or I could go home, but that I shouldn't be there anymore and I needed to take care of myself. My friend took me to the ER where I ended up getting a liter of fluids via IV because I was dehydrated and then sent home. Everyone including my friend thought that was good enough because of the circumstances. 

Saturday I wasn't quite bouncing back like I should have been, and if anything I had gotten a little worse. I didn't even make it to lunch before my friend decided we need to go back to the first aid area. By this time they knew who I was and the whole back story so we just had to fill them in with what happened at the ER on Friday. Or at least my friend did. I wasn't really in a position to do much of anything. Friday I was able to argue back and insist that I was fine. This time I had actually passed out at least once among a bunch of other red flags and I was sent back to the ER. This time by ambulance. I was given another liter of fluids by IV and they did blood tests that came back that I had started to become acidotic. That means that parts of my body were shutting down and turning my blood PH acidic. It was very minor so no permanent damage was done to my body, but it could have been a lot worse. That evening I was released and I spent the rest of the evening doing as little as possible and spending time with my team. I flew home Sunday morning. 

After I got home I wanted to do my job as mom, but I also knew that I needed to rest. It was so hard for me not to take care of everyone and everything. 

Monday morning my dear husband took the day off and took me to the insta-care near our house to get checked out. On our way there he told me "You know you are being a hypocrite" and I knew exactly what he meant by that. Here I am taking care of everyone else, taking care of everything else to the point of putting my needs aside and I don't want anyone else to help me. I needed last week/weekend to recharge and take care of myself because I knew that I had reached my limit and instead I pushed my body to do even more. And had it not been for a great friend it could have ended in disaster. Even after getting home I wanted to jump right back into my role as mom because "that's what I needed to do" when in reality I needed to let my husband and family take care of some things too. 

It is so easy to let ourselves get caught up in our "roles" that we lose sight of ourselves. As a coach I tell people all the time "you can't take care of the people that are most important to you if you don't take care of yourself first". I learned this weekend that sometimes that means letting go and doing nothing. I'm really good at working out, running, taking my shakeology, getting 7-8 hours of sleep every night, and sending my kids downstairs for "quiet time". I'm really bad at saying no and just taking the time to sit. I'm really bad at asking for help and letting someone else take care of me or even other things around the house. As a special needs mom I spend so much time taking care of others that, even though I know I need to take care of me, I forget to sit and listen to what part of me needs to be taken care of.
