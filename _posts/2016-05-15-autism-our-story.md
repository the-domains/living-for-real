We are a family of 6\. My husband and I have been married since 2004\. We have 4 wonderful children; boy, girl, boy, girl. The oldest was born 2008, then 2011, 2012, and 2015\. All 4 of them have some form of autism as well as some other diagnosis. We live in an alphabet soup.

My oldest is Buggy. He has moderate ASD and ADHD. He is very intelligent, friendly (sometimes too friendly), loving, caring, hardworking, curious, and outgoing. He also struggles greatly with making friends, sitting anywhere, talking about anything not interesting to him, expressing his feelings, and focusing on anything not interesting to him for extended periods of time. 

My second is Dolly. She has mild ASD, ADHD, and anxiety disorder. She is also a girl which can make diagnosis more difficult. She is intelligent, beautiful, energetic, loving, a caretaker, shy, and a total girly-girl. She also struggles with making friends (she wants to please them soo bad), sitting anywhere, doing any one thing for too long (not even an iPad or tv can hold her), and expressing her emotions. 

My third is Boo Boo Bear (Bear for short). He has mild ASD and ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). He is energetic, curious, a daredevil, smart, excitable, friendly, and loving. He struggles with authority, making friends, anyone getting in his face, being around people, noise, and speech. He is semi-verbal meaning he can talk, but doesn't say as much as other kids his age and it can be hard to understand what he is saying.

My last one is Baby. She is my baby and is only 18 months as I write this (7/22/16). She is non-verbal ASD. She is soo loving, smart, funny, cute, independent, and courageous. She struggles with lots as she has a really hard time communicating. She is a picky eater, and gets easily frustrated. We have taught her sign language and that helps with communication, but it is still a struggle.
