            <title><![CDATA[How do I do it?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have 4 active autistic kids. Some more severe than others. 1 non-verbal, 1 with ODD, and 1 that's moderate, smart, and talkative with ADHD. My 4th one is very emotional. All of this can be very draining, but I manage to get through my day, go to the grocery store, feed them 3 meals, and put them to bed clean and happy. When people meet me or see me I am generally very upbeat and happy. When they hear I have 4 autistic kids they are shocked. For 2 reasons. First, my kids "don't appear autistic" (whatever that means). And second, as I mentioned before, I seem very upbeat and happy. So they naturally ask or state in one form or another "How do you do it?" Well, here's your answer: I don't.</p>]]></description>
