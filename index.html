With cleaning the house, meals, laundry, bedtime, bathtime, school, appointments, and everything in between we just don't have time for ourselves. That doesn't include vacations, family gatherings, or holidays. We deem these things so important that we just push forward.

Some more severe than others. 1 non-verbal, 1 with ODD, and 1 that's moderate, smart, and talkative with ADHD. My 4th one is very emotional. All of this can be very draining, but I manage to get through my day, go to the grocery store, feed them 3 meals, and put them to bed clean and happy. When people meet me or see me I am generally very upbeat and happy. When they hear I have 4 autistic kids they are shocked. For 2 reasons. First, my kids "don't appear autistic" (whatever that means). And second, as I mentioned before, I seem very upbeat and happy. So they naturally ask or state in one form or another "How do you do it?" Well, here's your answer: I don't.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="90"><p>"What do you mean you don't?" I mean I don't do it. I don't control what I can't control. I don't expect anything out of my day except that my kids are fed, happy, alive, and clean. Anything else I get done, ie. dishes, vacuuming, laundry, ..., is a bonus. Some days I do get a little frustrated when I go to bed with a messy house, but I know that it will still be there tomorrow and I can try again. I also know that I feel worse when I get mad at my kids for being and acting exactly the way they are. Do you get mad at a baby for crying when they are hungry? Do you get mad at them for waking up in the middle of the night? Then how can I get mad at my kids for jumping all over the house because that's how they know how to regulate? How can I get mad when they chew on their shirt if I haven't given them an alternative and I know they can use it? No, that doesn't stop me from getting frustrated and angry at times. I am still human. </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="91"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="92"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="93"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="94"><span data-reactid="95"><!-- react-empty: 96 --><h2 data-reactid="97"><a data-reactid="98">Living For Real</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="99"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="100"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="101"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="102"></div></section></div></div>

Some more severe than others. 1 non-verbal, 1 with ODD, and 1 that's moderate, smart, and talkative with ADHD. My 4th one is very emotional. All of this can be very draining, but I manage to get through my day, go to the grocery store, feed them 3 meals, and put them to bed clean and happy. When people meet me or see me I am generally very upbeat and happy. When they hear I have 4 autistic kids they are shocked. For 2 reasons. First, my kids \"don't appear autistic\" (whatever that means). And second, as I mentioned before, I seem very upbeat and happy.
