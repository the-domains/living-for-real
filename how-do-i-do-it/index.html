Some more severe than others. 1 non-verbal, 1 with ODD, and 1 that's moderate, smart, and talkative with ADHD. My 4th one is very emotional. All of this can be very draining, but I manage to get through my day, go to the grocery store, feed them 3 meals, and put them to bed clean and happy. When people meet me or see me I am generally very upbeat and happy. When they hear I have 4 autistic kids they are shocked. For 2 reasons. First, my kids "don't appear autistic" (whatever that means). And second, as I mentioned before, I seem very upbeat and happy. So they naturally ask or state in one form or another "How do you do it?" Well, here's your answer: I don't.</p><p>"What do you mean you don't?" I mean I don't do it. I don't control what I can't control. I don't expect anything out of my day except that my kids are fed, happy, alive, and clean. Anything else I get done, ie. dishes, vacuuming, laundry, ..., is a bonus. Some days I do get a little frustrated when I go to bed with a messy house, but I know that it will still be there tomorrow and I can try again. I also know that I feel worse when I get mad at my kids for being and acting exactly the way they are. Do you get mad at a baby for crying when they are hungry? Do you get mad at them for waking up in the middle of the night? Then how can I get mad at my kids for jumping all over the house because that's how they know how to regulate? How can I get mad when they chew on their shirt if I haven't given them an alternative and I know they can use it? No, that doesn't stop me from getting frustrated and angry at times. I am still human. </p><p>I learned all of this the hard way with my first. Because he is moderate in severity and we didn't really know what we were looking at we didn't find out that he was autistic until he was 6 years old. That meant for the first 6 years, walking, talking, potty training (that was the hardest), starting school, and all of those formative pieces we thought he was neurotypical. (For more on how we got his diagnosis check out my post "Autism, Our Story".) We thought that he was a lot of things not autistic. We started potty training at 3-3.5 because he needed to be potty trained before preschool, or so we thought. He also "showed signs of readiness". For 2 years all he and I did was fight. He ultimately didn't potty train until he was 5 and even at 7 going on at we still have problems. Personal space/privacy is another big one that we fought about. He wanted/wants to touch everyone and everything. His grandpa had the hardest time with that one. In all the areas that I was taught mattered we fought. And I didn't know any better because he was my first child. He was just being strong willed I was told. That if I wanted him to learn I needed to not let him get me and not give in. He was labeled disruptive and a troublemaker in school. There wasn't a day that we weren't fighting about something I deemed important, chores, potty training, personal space, communication, .... </p><p>When he turned 6 my whole world changed. When I discovered who my child was and I entered his world I learned the truth about what was important. Unfortunately, that is a lesson I'm still learning, but that is a story for another time. Autism isn't just a set of or lack of behaviors. It is a whole different world. (See "What is Autism") I've often read/heard "I'm jealous of my autistic child. He doesn't care how the world views him. He does exactly what he wants without fear." I can tell you that's a lie. They know EXACTLY what the world thinks of them. So when it comes to doing what I do and caring for my 4 autistic children what then matters. What matters is of course the basics, food, clothing, shelter, and of course love. In addition I teach them to love, basic education (children's minds are like a sponge), and, when I can, appropriate social interaction (but I don't expect them to always get it right). </p><p>Love is the hardest because even my non-verbal and semi-verbal can tell when I'm upset and often times, because others in their life have actually expressed extreme displeasure with their behavior (and even I from time to time do get frustrated with it), think they have done something wrong. Lucky for them and for me communication has always been important to me and I express 2, 3, sometimes 10 times a day "I can't fix anything if you don't tell me about it". So they ask, "Mom, are you mad at me." "Why do you have a sad face?" I hate when they see my sad face, but they are very perceptive. Everything else is easy to provide.</p><p>What isn't important? Everything else. Potty training, not important. Clean room, not important. Folded clothes, not important. Eating with utensils, taught, always reiterated and encouraged, but not important. SITTING at the table IN their chairs, not important. I do insist that they stay in the dining area at the table though. Something other than Mac & Cheese, PB & J, hot dogs,and cereal for meals, we try new things but not important. When you enter their world and learn to listen it opens up new meanings. </p><p>Now here's the hard part. Even though I know all of this I still struggle. I still lose myself. I still cry. I still yell and get angry and fight. I go into my room, lock the door, and cry. I am human and I fault. </p><p>And I still don't. I don't take care of myself the way I should. I don't talk about what is wrong because I've been taught that I shouldn't. I don't show that I'm upset or struggling. I don't eat healthy, I don't have a clean house no matter how hard I try. I don't let in the world or sometimes even the people I care the most about. It's something that I am always working on. So, for right now. How do I do it? I don't.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="27"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="29"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="30"><span data-reactid="31"><!-- react-empty: 32 --><h2 data-reactid="33"><a data-reactid="34">Living For Real</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="37"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="38"></div></section></div></div>
